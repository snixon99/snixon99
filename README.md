Heyyy everybody, I’m @snixon99,

I'm a 31(m) hoping to one day move from a career in Civil Engineering to something tech related. I can write a bit of Java and have written a few little
scripts to solve some niche issues at work. I have recently begun to delve into the world of web development.  It appears that it's at least possible to
get hired into a web dev position without having a degree in Computer Science.  I have a B.S. in Civil Engineering but I'm not sure how much a potential
employer would care about something like that.

I'll be looking around on GitHub, as time allows, to see if I can find something I can contribute to.  I have found that there is absolutly no substitute
for sitting down and actually coding.  I tend to only spend significant time coding if I have a problem I need solved at work.  I have no such problem at
the momment so hopefully I can find something to tinker with on this site.
